Fortify CloudScan Jenkins Plugin
==============================

Fortify CloudScan allows an organization to host their own internal cloud-based infrastructure of Static Code Analyzer (SCA) machines that are distributed jobs by a centralized controller and optionally integrated with Software Security Center (SSC). CloudScan is included with Fortify 4.30 and higher and was an optional component in previous versions of Fortify.

This plugin provides simple configuration of CloudScan jobs without sacrificing the flexibility of performing custom scan jobs.

Additional information, usage, and configuration options are documented on the Jenkins [wiki].
