<div>
    <p>Specifies the maximum amount of memory used by SCA. By default, it uses up to 600 MB of memory, which can be insufficient for large code bases. When specifying this option, ensure that you do not allocate more memory than is physically available, because this degrades performance. As a guideline, assuming no other memory intensive processes are running, do not allocate more than 2/3 of the available memory.</p>
    <p>Expected format examples: (4096m or 4g)</p>
