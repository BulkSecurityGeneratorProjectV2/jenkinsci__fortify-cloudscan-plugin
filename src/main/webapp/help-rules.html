    <p>Specifies custom rulepacks or directories. When specifying a directory, all of the files in the
        directory with .bin and .xml extensions are included.</p>
    <p>This field supports rulepack filesystem locations as well as URL's. The URLs may be to individual
        .bin or .xml rulepacks, or to .zip archives containing multiple rulepacks. The contents are
        downloaded, optionally unzipped, and placed into a temporary directory where they will be
        picked up automatically by Cloudscan.
