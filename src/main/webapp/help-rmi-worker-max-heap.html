    Sets the heap size for the workers. The amount of memory required varies from project to project,
    but you do not have to allocate as much memory for the workers as you do for the master JVM.
    This property accepts values in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), or Gigabytes (G).
    <p>
    You might need to experiment with this property if you experience low memory warnings, crashes,
    or do not achieve a speed increase.
